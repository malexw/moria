The most recent version of UNIX Moria can be obtained via
anonymous ftp from ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU at present.
The files are in the directory pub/wilson.
In the future, I shall try to keep the sources available on
ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU and/or ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU.

Restoring touched save files is possible, but not very easy.
The following is a rough outline of the steps necessary:
1) User changes mode of save file so that wizard can read it.
2) Wizard changes umask so that files created will be publicly writable
    i.e. for csh type 'umask 0'
   Also, the directory that this is done in must be publicly writable.
3) Wizard uses 'wizard restore' command to read in touched save file.
4) While still in wizard mode, save the game.
5) User can then read in the new save file, deleting it in the process.
6) Wizard changes umask back to original value, i.e. 'umask 22'.

Enter wizard mode by using the ^W command, help is ^H. (Or for the
rogue-like option, ^W and ^?).
