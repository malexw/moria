NAME
     moria - a dungeon game

SYNOPSIS
     moria [ -r ] [ -s ] [ savefile ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_o_r_i_a plays a dungeon game with you.  It generates a charac-
     ter for you, lets you buy equipment, and lets you wander in
     a fathomless dungeon while finding treasure and being
     attacked by monsters and fellow adventurers.  Typing ? gives
     you a list of commands.

     The ultimate object of _m_o_r_i_a is to kill the Balrog, which
     dwells on the 50th level of the dungeon, 2,500 feet under-
     ground.  Most players never even reach the Balrog, and those
     that do seldom live to tell about it.

     You move in various directions by pressing the numeric
     keypad keys, VMS-style.  If you specify -r, you move the
     same way you do in _r_o_g_u_e(6).

     If you specify -s, _m_o_r_i_a prints a list of the twenty top
     scorers and exits.

AUTHORS
     The original version of Moria was written for VMS by Robert
     Alan Koeneke, Jimmey Wayne Todd, Gary McAdoo, and others at
     the University of Oklahoma.  This Unix version was written
     by Jim Wilson (ucbernie!wilson).

BUGS
     The SYS V version does not lock the scoreboard, if two
     processes try to modify it at the same time, it may become
     corrupted.

     Wearing an amulet or ring that would raise a stat over
     18/100 actually only raises the stat to 18/100.  When the
     amulet is removed, the stat drops to a value below its ori-
     ginal value.

     Probably infinite (although countably infinite).
