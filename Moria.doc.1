Introduction
.LP
The game of \fImoria\fP is a single player dungeon simulation.
A player may choose from a number of races and classes when
creating a character, and then `run' that character over a
period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by
defeating the Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels.
.LP
The player will begin his adventure on the town level where
he may acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by
bartering with various shop owners.
After preparing for his adventure, the player can descend into the
dungeons of \fImoria\fP where fantastic adventures await his coming!
.LP
Before beginning your first adventure, you should read this
document carefully.
The game of \fImoria\fP is a complicated game, and
will require a dedicated player to win.

.NH 1
The Character
.LP
All characters have six main attributes which modify their basic abilities.
These six attributes, called \fIstats\fP, are
\fIstrength\fP, \fIintelligence\fP, \fIwisdom\fP, \fIdexterity\fP,
\fIconstitution\fP, and \fIcharisma\fP.
Stats may vary from 3 as a minimum to 18/100 as a maximum.
Because adventurers of interest tend to be better than
average characters, \fImoria\fP stats will average about 12.5, and are
further adjusted by race and class.
Some races are just naturally better at being certain classes, as will be
shown
later.
.LP
In addition to the more visible stats, each character has certain abilities
which are mainly determined by his race and class, but are also modified
by his stats.
The abilities are \fIfighting\fP, \fIthrowing/bows\fP, \fIsaving throw\fP,
\fIstealth\fP, \fIdisarming\fP, \fImagical devices\fP, \fIperception\fP,
\fIsearching\fP, and \fIinfra-vision\fP.
.LP
Characters will be assigned an early history, with money and a social class
based on that history.
Starting money is assigned based on history, charisma, and somewhat upon the
average of a character's stats.
A character with below average stats will receive extra money to help
him survive the first adventure.
.LP
Each character will also have physical attributes such as a
race, a height, weight, sex, and a physical description.
None of
these, except weight, play any part in the game other than to
give the player a \*Qfeeling\*U for his character.
Weight is used for computing carrying capacity and also for \fIbashing\fP.
.LP
Finally each character is assigned \fIhit points\fP based on their race,
class, and constitution.
Spell casters will also receive \fImana\fP which is expended when casting
spells.
Mana is based on Wisdom for Priests and Intelligence for Mages.

.NH 2
Character Stats
.IP "Strength"
Strength is important in fighting with weapons, or hand to hand.
A high strength can improve your chances of hitting, and the amount of
damage done with each hit.
Characters with low strengths may receive penalties.
Strength is also useful in tunneling, body and shield bashing, and in
carrying heavy items.
.IP "Intelligence"
Intelligence is the prime stat of a mage, or magician.
A high intelligence increases a mage's chances of learning spells, and in
gaining mana.
No spell may be learned by mages with intelligences under 8.
Intelligence also modifies a character's chance of disarming traps and
picking locks.
.IP "Wisdom  "
Wisdom is the prime stat of a priest.
A high wisdom increases the chance of receiving new spells from a priest's
diety, and in the gaining of mana.
Wisdom also modifies a character's chance of resisting magical spells
cast upon his person.
.IP "Dexterity"
Dexterity is the combination of agility and quickness.
A high dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter
weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and may increase his
chances of hitting with any weapon.
Dexterity is also useful in picking locks and disarming traps.
.IP "Constitution"
Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to their body, and to
recover from damage received.
Therefore a character with a high constitution will receive more hit points,
and be more resistant to poisons.
.IP "Charisma"
Charisma represents a character's personality, as well as physical looks.
A character with a high charisma will receive better prices from store
owners, whereas a character with a very low charisma will be robbed blind.
A high charisma will also mean more starting money for the character.

.NH 2
Character Sex
.LP
You may choose to be either a male or a female character.
Only height and weight are affected by a character's sex.
Female characters tend to be somewhat smaller and lighter then their
male counterparts.
No adjustments to stats or abilities are made because of the sex of
a character.

.NH 2
Character Abilities
.LP
Characters possess nine different abilities which can help
them to survive. The starting abilities of a character are based
upon race and class. Abilities may be adjusted by high or low
stats, and may increase with the level of the character.
.IP "Fighting"
Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
fists. Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon,
but if his dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive
more blows per round with lighter weapons. Strength and
dexterity both modify the ability to hit an opponent. In
addition this skill increases with the level of the character.
.IP "Throwing/Bows"
Using stand-off missile weapons and throwing objects is
included in this skill. Different stats apply to different
weapons, but may modify the distance an object is thrown/fired,
the amount of damage done, and the ability to hit a creature.
This skill increases with the level of the character.
.IP "Saving Throw"
A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the
effects of a spell cast on him by another person/creature. Note
that this does not include spells cast on the player by his own
stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty potion. This ability
increases with the level of the character, but then most high
level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to even
out.
.IP "Stealth"
The ability to move silently about is very useful.
Characters with good stealth can usually surprise their
opponents, gaining the first blow. Also, creatures may fail to
notice a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid
certain fights.
.IP "Disarming"
Disarming is the ability to remove traps (safely), and
includes picking locks on traps and doors. Note that a
successful disarming will gain the character some experience.
The character must have found a trap before it can be disarmed.
Dexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to disarm, and
this ability increases with the level of the character.
.IP "Using Magical Devices"
Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires
experience and knowledge. Spell users such as mages and priests
are therefore much better at using a magical device than say a
fighter. This skill is modified by intelligence, and increases
with the level of the character.
.IP "Perception"
Perception is the ability to notice something without
actively seeking it out. This skill is based entirely upon race
and class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
.IP "Searching"
To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
and traps on chests. Rogues are the best at searching, but
mages, rangers, and priests are also good at it. Intelligence
modifies your searching ability, and your ability will also
increase with your level.
.IP "Infra Vision"
Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most
of the dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the
player to see walls and objects. Infra-vision will allow a
character to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a certain
distance. This ability works equally well with or with out a
light source. Note that the majority of \fImoria\fP's creatures are
cold blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light
source.

.NH 2
Choosing A Race
.LP
There are eight different races that you can choose from in
\fImoria\fP. Some races are restricted as to what profession they may
be, and each race has its own adjustments to a character's stats
and abilities.
.IP "Human  "
The human is the base character, all other races are
compared to him. Humans can choose any class, and are average
at everything. Humans tend to go up levels faster than any other
race, because of their shorter life-spans. No racial adjustments
occur to characters choosing human.
.IP "Half-Elf"
Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a human, but
not as strong. Half-elves are slightly better at searching,
disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but they are not as
good at hand weapons. Half-elves may choose any class.
.IP "Elf      "
Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
fighting. They tend to be smarter and faster than either humans
or half-elves, and also have better wisdom. Elves are better at
searching, disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but they
are not as good at hand weapons. Elves may choose any class
except Paladin.
.IP "Halfling"
Halflings, or Hobbits, are very good at bows, throwing, and
have good saving throws. They also are very good at searching,
disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excellent
thieves (but prefer to be called burglars...). They will be much
weaker than humans, and no good at bashing. Halflings have fair
infra-vision, so can detect warm creatures at a distance.
Halflings can choose between being a fighter, mage, or rogue.
.IP "Gnome   "
Gnomes are smaller than dwarfs, but larger than halflings.
They, like the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes.
Gnomes are practical jokers, so if they can kill something in a
humorous way, so much the better. Gnomes make excellent mages,
and have very good saving throws. They are good at searching,
disarming, perception, and stealth. They have lower strength
than humans so they are not very good at
fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so
can detect warm creatures at a distance. A gnome may choose
between being a fighter, mage, priest, or rogue.
.IP "Dwarf  "
Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.
Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are
excellent choices for a warrior or priest. Dwarves tend to be
stronger, have higher constitutions, but are slower and less
intelligent than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are
somewhat wise, they resist spells which are cast on them.
Dwarves also have good infra-vision because they live
underground. They do have one big draw-back though. Dwarves are
loud-mouthed and proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with
themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges at
imagined foes. In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.
.IP "Half-Orc"
Half-Orcs make excellent fighters, and decent priests, but
are terrible at magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception. Half-Orcs
are, let's face it, ugly. They tend to pay more for goods in
town. Half-Orcs do make good priests and rogues, for the simple
reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lots
of hit points.
.IP "Half-Troll"
Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have the highest hit
points of any character race. They are also very stupid and
slow. They will make great fighters and iffy priests. They are
bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They are
so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence. They also
happen to be fun to run...

.NH 2
Choosing A Class
.LP
Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.
Some classes will not be available to certain races, for instance
a Half-Troll cannot become a Paladin. For the first few
adventures it is suggested that you run a warrior or rogue.
Spell casting generally requires a more experienced player that
is familiar with survival techniques.
.IP "Warrior"
A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of
his problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally
fall back on the help of a magical device. His prime stats are
Strength and Constitution, and a good Dexterity can really help
at times. A Warrior will be good at Fighting and Throwing/Bows,
but bad at most other skills.
.IP "Mage    "
A Mage must live by his wits. He cannot hope to simply hack
his way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic
to defeat, deceive, confuse, and to escape with. A mage is not
really complete without a golf-cart of magical devices to use in
addition to his spells. He can master the higher level magical
devices far easier than anyone else, and has the best saving
throw to resist effects of spells cast at him. Intelligence and
Dexterity are his primary stats. There is no rule that says a
mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are his true realm.
.IP "Priest  "
A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the
dungeon only to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if
treasure just happens to fall into their packs, well, so much
more to the glory of their church! Priests receive their spells
from a diety, and therefore do not choose which spells they will
learn. He is familiar with magical devices, preferring to call
them instruments of god, but is not as good as a mage in their
use. Priests have good saving throws, and make decent fighters,
preferring blunt weapons over edged ones. Wisdom and Charisma
are the priest's primary stats.
.IP "Rogue   "
A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning,
but is capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot. He is
the master of traps and locks, no device being impossible for him
to over-come. A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to sneak
around many creatures without having to fight, or sneak up and
get the first blow. A rogue's perception is higher than any
other class, and many times he will notice a trap or secret door
before having to search. A rogue is better than warriors or
paladins with magical devices, but still can not rely on their
performance. A rogue's primary stats are Intelligence and
Dexterity.
.IP "Ranger  "
A Ranger is a fighter/mage. He is a good fighter, and the
best of the classes with a missile weapon such as a bow. The
ranger learns spells much more slowly than a mage, but is capable
of learning all but the most powerful spell. Because a ranger is
really a dual class character, it requires more experience to
advance him. A ranger has a good stealth, good perception, good
searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical devices.
His primary stats are Intelligence and Dexterity.
.IP "Paladin"
A Paladin is a fighter/priest. He is a very good fighter,
second only to the warrior class, but not very good at missile
weapons. He receives prayers at a slower pace then the priest,
and can receive all but the most powerful prayer. Because a
paladin is really a dual class character, it requires more
experience to advance him. A paladin lacks much in the way of
abilities. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and
magical devices. He has a decent saving throw due to his divine
alliance. His primary stats are Strength and Charisma.

Adventuring
.LP
After you have created your character, you will begin your
\fImoria\fP adventure. Symbols appearing on your screen will represent
the dungeon's walls and floor, objects and features, and
creatures lurking about. In order to direct your character
through his adventure, you will enter single character commands.
.LP
\fIMoria\fP symbols and commands each have a help section devoted
to them. You should review these sections before attempting an
adventure. Finally, a description of the town level and some
general help on adventuring are included.

.NH 2
Symbols On Your Map
.LP
Symbols on your map can be broken down into three
categories: Features of the dungeon such as walls, floor, doors,
and traps; Objects which can be picked up such as treasure,
weapons, magical devices, etc; and Monsters which may or may not
move about the dungeon, but are mostly harmful to your
character's well being.
.LP
Note that some symbols can be in more than one category.
Also note that treasure may be imbedded in a wall, and the wall
must be removed before the treasure can be picked up.
.LP
It will not be necessary to remember all of the symbols and
their meanings. A simple command, the `/', will identify any
character appearing on your map. See the section on commands for
further help.

Commands
.LP
All commands are entered by pressing a single key, or
control sequence (holding down the control key while pressing a
key). If a particular command requires additional action, it
will be prompted for, with one exception. When a direction is
required, no prompt is given unless and until an illegal response
is given.
.LP
For each command, the characters used by the original style option are
listed first, followed by the characters used by the rogue-like
option in braces, if different.

.NH 3
Note On <Dir>
.LP
For the original style option,
in the following instructions, the symbol <Dir> refers to a
numeric direction based on your keypad.
For the rogue-like option, the symbol <Dir> refers to one of the
following letters `hykulnjb', or to a numeric direction based on
your keypad.
It is not valid to use
the number `5' in this context. One exception to this is with
movement, in which case `5' will rest the character for one turn.
For the rogue-like option, `.' will also rest the character for one
turn.
.LP
Commands which require a direction will not prompt you for
one, unless you input an illegal direction. Just enter a
direction after the entering the command.

For the original style option, movement is accomplished
by using your numeric keypad.
Simply press a number and your character will move one step in
that direction.
For the rogue-like option, movement is accomplished by using the
numeric keypad, or one of the directional characters mentioned above.
Pressing a `5' is equivalent to waiting for one
round (More efficient resting over long periods of time is
accomplished by using the Rest command). You can only move onto
and through floor spots, and only if they contain no creatures or
obstructing objects such as a closed door.
.LP
Moving your character one step at a time can be time
consuming and boring, so a faster method has been supplied.
For the original style option, by
using the Move command `.', you may move in a direction until
something interesting happens. For instance, by pressing the
period key `.' followed by the direction 8, your character would
continue to move up the screen, only coming to a stop after at
least one condition is satisfied.
For the rogue-like option, typing a shifted directional letter
will move you in that direction until something interesting happens.
These stopping conditions are:
.IP "[1]"
A creature appears upon the screen, or a creature already on
the screen moves.
.IP "[2]"
You move next to an object, or feature such as a door,
staircase, or trap.
.IP "[3]"
You come to a wall, and have more than one choice of
directions from which to continue, or are in a dead end
passage.
.IP "[4]"
You come to a junction of several passages.

.IP "B <Dir> - Bash {f - force}"
The Bash command includes breaking open doors and chests, or
bashing an opponent. Two main factors determine the ability of a
character to bash, their weight and their strength. In addition,
when bashing an opponent, you will either perform a body bash, or,
if wielding a shield, perform a shield bash which is more
effective.
.sp
Bashing a door can throw the character off-balance, but this
will not generally be a problem. Doors that have been jammed
closed with spikes can only be opened by bashing. Locked doors
may also be bashed open. Note that bashing a door open will
permanently break it.
.sp
Bashing a creature has effects on both the player and his
opponent. Depending on a character's dexterity, he may or may
not be thrown off-balance allowing free moves to his opponents.
.sp
If the bash is successful, the opponent will be thrown
off-balance for 1 or 2 turns, thus allowing the character free
hits or a chance to run.
.sp
A player automatically performs a shield bash instead of a
body bash, if he is currently wearing a shield. A shield bash
adds the damage of a shield to that of the bash, so is more
effective. Note that size and material both affect the damage
that a shield will do.
.IP "C  - Print character (to screen or file)"
This command allows the player to either display his
character on the terminal screen, or to print an entire character
info listing to a file. If printed to a file, history, equipment
list, and an inventory list are included.
.IP "D <Dir> - Disarm a trap."
You can attempt to disarm floor traps, or trapped chests.
If you fail to disarm a trap, there is a chance that you blunder
and set it off. You can only disarm a trap on a chest after
finding it with the search command.
.IP "E  - Eat some food."
A character must eat occasionally to remain effective. As a
character grows hungry, a message will appear at the bottom of
the screen saying \*QHungry\*U. If a character remains hungry long
enough, he will become weak and eventually start fainting.
.IP "F  - Fill a lamp or lantern with oil."
If your character is currently using a lamp for light, and
if he has a flask of oil in inventory, he may refill the lamp by
using this command. A lamp is capable of a maximum of 5500 turns
of light, and each flask has 5000 turns of oil contained in it.
.IP "L  - Display map co-ordinates. {W - where}"
The Location command will display your character's current
co-ordinates as shown on a printed map (printed with the `P'
command). Sectors contain up to 44 rows by 99 columns each. The
Location command will display the character's current row and
column map co-ordinates, as well as the sector number.
.IP "P  - Print map to file. {M - map}"
The Print command will write an entire map of the dungeon
floor explored to a file. Since the dungeon floor is large, the
map is broken up into sectors, each containing up to 44 rows by
99 columns.
.IP "R  - Rest for a number of turns."
You may rest one turn by pressing the `5' key. Resting for
longer periods of time is accomplished by using the Rest command,
followed by the number of turns you want to rest your character.
Resting will continue until the specified duration has expired,
or something to wake the character happens, such as a creature
wandering by. It is sometimes a good idea to rest a beat-up
character until he regains some of his hit points, but be sure to
have plenty of food if you rest often.
.sp
If you have accidently entered in a rest period too large,
or change your mind about the resting period, you may wake your
character up by typing control-C.
.IP "S  - Search mode toggle. {#}"
The Searching toggle will take the character into and out of
searching mode. When first pressed, the message \*QSearching\*U will
appear at the bottom of the screen. The character is now taking
two turns for each command, one for the command and one turn to
search about him. Note that this means he is taking twice the
time to move about the dungeon, and therefore twice the food. If
a creature should happen by or attack you, search mode will
automatically shut off. Otherwise you may turn off search mode
by again pressing the `S' key.
.IP "T <Dir> - Tunnel through rock. {control-<Dir>}"
Tunneling (Mining) is a very useful art. There are four
kinds of rock present in the dungeons of \fImoria\fP: Permanent Rock,
Granite Rock, Magma Intrusion, and Quartz Veins. Permanent Rock
is exactly that, permanent. Granite is very hard, therefore hard
to dig through, and contains no valuable metals. Magma and
Quartz veins are softer and sometimes bare valuable metals and
gems, shown as a `$' or a `*' character. You can tell if the
metal or gems are embedded into the wall by trying to move onto
them. If you can't move over them, you'll have to dig them out.
.sp
Tunneling can be VERY difficult by hand, so when you dig be
sure to wield either a shovel or a pick. Magical shovels and
picks can be found which allow the wielder to dig much faster
than normal, and a good strength also helps.
.sp
It is sometimes possible to get a character trapped within
the dungeon by using various magical spells and items. So it is
a very good idea to always carry some kind of digging tool, even
when you are not planning on tunneling for treasure.
.IP "a <Dir> - Aim a wand. {z - zap}"
Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used. Wands are a
magical device and therefore use the Magical Devices ability of
the player. They will either affect the first object/creature
encountered, or affect anything in a given direction, depending
upon the wand. An obstruction such as door or wall will generally
stop the effects of a wand from traveling further.
.IP "b  - Browse a book. {P - peruse}"
You can only read a book if you are of its realm.
Therefore a magic user could read a magic book, but not a holy
book. Fighters will not be able to read either kind of book.
When the browse command is used, all of the spells or prayers
contained in the book along with information about it, such as
its level, the amount of mana used up in casting it, and whether
or not you know the spell or prayer, will be displayed. There
are a total of 31 different magical spells in four books, and 31
different prayers in four books.
.IP "c <Dir> - Close a door."
Non-intelligent and certain other creatures will not be able
to open a door. Therefore shutting doors can be a life saver.
You must be adjacent to an open door, and you cannot close broken
doors. Note that bashing a door open will break it.
.IP "d  - Drop an object from your inventory."
You can drop a single object onto the floor beneath you if
that floor spot does not already contain an object. Note that
doors and traps are considered objects in this sense. If you
drop an object such as a potion or scroll, a single one is
dropped onto the floor at a time. Group objects such as arrows
are all dropped at once onto the floor.
.IP "e  - Display a list of equipment being used."
Use the Equipment command to display a list of objects
currently being used by your character. Note that each object
has a specific place where it is placed, and that only one object
of each type may be used at any one time, excepting rings of
which two can be worn, one on each hand.
.IP "f <Dir> - Fire/Throw an object/Use a missile weapon. {t - throw}"
You may throw any object carried by your character.
Depending upon the weight of an object, it may travel across a
room or drop down beside you. If you throw an object such as an
arrow, only one will be used at a time.
.sp
If you throw at a creature, your chance of hitting the
creature is determined by your pluses to hit, your ability at
throwing, and the object's pluses to hit. Once the creature is
hit, the object may or may not do any actual damage to it.
Certain objects in the dungeon can do great amounts of damage
when thrown, but it's for you to figure out the obscure ones.
Oil flasks are considered to be lit before thrown, therefore they
will do fire damage to a creature if they hit it.
.sp
To use a bow with arrows, simply wield the bow and throw the
arrows. Extra pluses to damage and hitting are gained by
wielding the proper weapon and throwing the corresponding ammo.
A heavy crossbow with bolts for example, is a killer...
.IP "h  - Enter the \fImoria\fP help library"
A subprocess is spawned and the HELP utility entered. Help
on individual commands may be displayed without actually exiting
your game.
This is currently unimplemented.
.IP "i  - Display a list of objects being carried."
The Inventory command displays a list of all objects being
carried, but are not in current use. You may carry up to 22
different kinds of objects, not including those in your equipment
list. Depending upon your strength, you will be able carry many
identical objects before hitting your weight limit.
.IP "j <Dir> - Jam a door with an iron spike. {S - spike}"
Most humanoid and many intelligent creatures can simply open
a closed door, and can eventually get through a locked door.
Therefore you may spike a door in order to jam it. Each spike
used on a door will increase its strength. It is very easy to
jam a door so much as to make it impossible for your character to
bash it down, so spike doors wisely. Note that the bigger a
creature is, the easier it can bash a door down. Therefore four
or more spikes might be necessary to slow down a dragon, where
one spike would slow down a kobold.
.IP "m  - Cast a magic spell."
First, a character must have learned a spell before he can
cast it. Next, when casting a spell, he must read the spell from
a book, so a book containing the spell must be in his inventory.
Each spell has a chance of failure which starts out fairly large
but decreases as a character gains levels. If a character does
not have the available mana, he increases his chance of failure,
and gambles on losing a point of constitution. Note that since a
character must read the spell from a book, he cannot be blind or
confused when casting a spell, and there must be some light
present.
.IP "l <Dir> - Look in a direction. {x - examine}"
The Look command is useful in identifying the exact type of
object or creature shown on the screen. Also, if a creature is
on top of an object, the look command will describe both. You
can see creatures and objects up to 200 feet away (20 units).
Note that you may freely use the Look command without the
creatures getting a move on you.
.IP "o <Dir> - Open a door, chest, or lock."
To open an object such as a door or chest you must use the
Open command. If the object is locked, the Open command will
attempt to pick the lock, based on your ability at disarming.
Note that if an object is trapped and you open it, the trap will
be set off.
.IP "p  - Read a prayer."
First, a character must have learned a prayer before he can
read it. Next, when reading a prayer, he must have the book
containing the prayer in his inventory. Each prayer has a chance
of failure which starts out fairly large but decreases as a
character gains levels. If a character does not have the
available mana, he increases his chance of failure, and gambles
on losing a point of constitution. Note that since a character
must read the prayer from a book, he cannot be blind or confused
and there must be some light present.
.IP "q  - Quaff a potion."
To drink a potion use the Quaff command. A potion affects
the player in some manner. The effects of the potion may be
immediately noticed, or they may be subtle and unnoticed.
.IP "r  - Read a scroll."
To read a scroll use the Read command. A scroll spell has
an area affect, except in a few cases such as identify scrolls
which act on other objects. Note that two scrolls, the identify
scroll and the recharge scroll, have titles which can be read
without setting them off, and by pressing <ESCAPE> can be saved
for future use.
.IP "s  - Search general area one turn."
The Search command can be used to locate hidden traps and
secret doors about the player. Note that more than a single turn
of searching will be required in most cases. You should always
search a chest before trying to open it because they are
generally trapped.
.IP "t  - Take off a piece of equipment. {T}"
Use the Take-Off command to remove an object from use, and
return it to your inventory. Occasionally you will run into a
cursed item which cannot be removed. Cursed items are always
bad, and can only be taken off after removing the curse.
.IP "u  - Use a staff. {Z - Zap}"
The Use command will activate a staff. Like scrolls, most
staffs have an area affect. Because staffs are generally more
powerful than most other items, they are also harder to use
correctly.
.IP "v  - Display current version of game."
The Version command displays the credits for the current
version of \fImoria\fP.
.IP "w  - Wear or wield an item being carried."
To wear or wield an object in your inventory, use the
Wear/Wield command. If an object is already in use for the same
function, it is automatically removed first. Note that an
object's bonuses cannot be gained until it is worn or wielded.
.IP "x  - Exchange primary and secondary weapons. {X}"
A secondary weapon is any weapon which may be needed often.
Instead of searching through your inventory, you may use the
exchange command to keep the weapon ready. For instance, if you
wanted to use your bow most of the time, but needed a sword for
close combat, you could wield your sword, use the exchange
command to make it the secondary weapon, then wield your bow. If
the sword was suddenly needed, simply use the exchange command to
switch between the bow and the sword.
.IP "/  - Identify a character shown on screen."
Use the identify command to find out what a character
displayed on the screen stands for. For instance, by
pressing `/.', you can find out that the `.' stands for a floor spot.
When used with a creature, the identify command will tell you
only what class of creature the symbol stands for, not the
specific creature, therefore use the look command for this
information.
.IP "?  - Display a list of commands."
The ? command displays a one page quick reference help page
on the screen.
.IP "^P  - Repeat last message."
The <Control>-P command will
re-display the last message printed on the message line at the
top of your screen.  You can read the last twenty messages by repeatedly
typing ^P.
.IP "^R  - Redraw the screen."
To redraw the entire screen, use the <Control>-R command.
.IP "^K  - Quit the game without saving. {Q}"
To exit the game without saving your character (i.e. kill him/her)
use the
<Control>-K command. Once exited in this manner, your character
is non-recoverable.
.IP "^X  - Save your character and exit the game."
To save your game so that it can be restarted later, use the
<Control>-X command. The save file cannot be moved, or read.
Do not try to tamper with it.
Note that a copy of a saved character will
not work after that character has died.
.IP "$  - Shell out of game. {!}"
Use the Shell command `$' to temporarily exit the game to
execute UNIX commands. You may re-enter the game by typing exit
to end the spawned process.
.IP "<  - Go up an up-staircase."
If you move onto an up-staircase you may use the `<' command
to go up one level. There is always one staircase going up on
every level except for the town level (this does not mean it's
easy to find). Going up a staircase will always take you to a
new dungeon area except for the town level, which remains the
same for the duration of your character.
.IP ">  - Go down a down-staircase."
If you are on top of a down-staircase you may use the `>'
command to go down one level. There are always two or three
staircases going down on each level, except the town level which
has only one. Going down will always take you to a new dungeon
area.
.IP ". <Dir> - Move in direction. {shift<Dir>}"
The Move command `.' will move you in the indicated
direction until one of several conditions happen. These
conditions include: a creature appearing on the screen, a
creature already on the screen moving, an object or feature such
as a door, a staircase, or a trap is adjacent to the character,
character comes into a junction of passages, or character comes
to a wall with no choice or more than one choice of continuing
directions.
