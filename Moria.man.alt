.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Moria\^
plays a dungeon game with you.
It generates a character for you,
lets you buy equipment,
and lets you wander in a fathomless dungeon
while finding treasure and being attacked by monsters
and fellow adventurers.
Typing
.B ?
gives you a list of commands.
.PP
The ultimate object of
.I moria
is to kill the Balrog,
which dwells on the 50th level of the
dungeon, 2,500 feet underground.
Most players never even reach the Balrog,
and those that do seldom live to tell about it.
.PP
You move in various directions
.ie '\*O'ROGUE_LIKE' the same way you do in \fIrogue\fP(6).
.el by pressing the numeric keypad keys, VMS-style.
If you specify
.ie '\*O'ROGUE_LIKE' \fB\-o\fP, you move by pressing the numeric keypad keys, VMS-style.
.el \fB\-r\fP, you move the same way you do in \fIrogue\fP(6).
.PP
If you specify

.SH AUTHORS
The original version of Moria was written for VMS by Robert
Alan Koeneke, Jimmey Wayne Todd,
Gary McAdoo, and others at the University of Oklahoma.
This Unix version was written by Jim Wilson (ucbernie\^!\^wilson).
.SH BUGS
.PP
The SYS V version does not lock the scoreboard, if two processes try
to modify it at the same time, it may become corrupted.

Wearing an amulet or ring that would raise a stat over 18/100 actually only
raises the stat to 18/100.  When the amulet is removed, the stat drops to
a value below its original value.

Probably infinite (although countably infinite).
