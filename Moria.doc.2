.NH 2
The Town Level
.LP
The town level is where you will begin your adventure. The
town consists of six buildings each with an entrance, some
towns `people', and a wall which surrounds the town. The first time
you are in town it will be daytime, but you may return to find
that darkness has fallen. (Note that some spells may act
differently in the town level.)

.NH 3
Townspeople
.LP
The town contains many different kinds of people. There are
the street urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for
money, and seem to come out of the woodwork when excited.
Blubbering Idiots are a constant annoyance, but not harmful.
Public drunks wander about the town singing, and are of no
threat to anyone. Sneaky rogues hang about watching for a
likely victim to mug. And finally, what town would be complete
without a swarm of half drunk warriors, who take offense or
become annoyed just for the fun of it.
.LP
Most of the towns people should be avoided by the largest
possible distance when you wander from store to store. Fights
will break out though, so be prepared. Since your character grew
up in this world of intrigue, no experience is awarded for
killing on the town level.

.NH 3
Supplies
.LP
Your character will begin his adventure with some supplies
already on him. Use the Inventory `i' command to check what
these supplies are. It will be necessary to buy other supplies
before continuing into the dungeon, however, so be sure to enter
each of the stores.

.NH 3
Town Buildings
.LP
You may enter any of the stores, if they are open, and
barter with the owner for items you can afford. But be warned
that the owners can easily be insulted, and may even throw you
out for a while if you insult them too often. To enter a store,
simply move onto the entrance represented by the numbers 1
through 6.
.LP
Once inside a store, his inventory will appear on the screen
along with a set of options for your character. You may browse
the store's inventory if it takes more than one page to display,
and you may sell or purchase items in his inventory. You can
execute your inventory and equipment commands to see what you are
carrying. Not shown with the options are the wear, take-off, and
exchange commands which will also work, but were excluded to keep
the options simple.
.LP
Stores do not always have everything in stock. As the game
progresses, they may get new items so check from time to time.
Also, if you sell them an item, it may get sold to a customer
while you are adventuring so don't always expect to be able to
get back anything you have sold.
.LP
Store owners will not buy harmful or useless items. If an
object is unidentified, they will pay you some base price for it.
Once they have bought it they will immediately identify the
object. If it is a good object, they will add it to their
inventory. If it was a bad bargain, they simply throw the item
away. In any case, you may receive some knowledge of the item if
another is encountered.
.IP "The General Store"
The General Store sells foods, drinks, some clothing,
torches, lamps, oil, and spikes. All of these items, and others,
can be sold back to the General store for money. The entrance to
the General Store is a `1'.
.IP "The Armory"
The Armory is where the town's armor is fashioned. All
sorts of protective gear may be bought and sold here. The
entrance to the Armory is a `2'.
.IP "The Weaponsmith\'s Shop"
The Weaponsmith's Shop is where the town's weapons are
fashioned. Hand and missile weapons may be purchased and sold
here, along with arrows, bolts, and shots. The entrance to the
Weaponsmith's is a `3'.
.IP "The Temple"
The Temple deals in healing and restoration potions, as well
as bless scrolls, word-of-recall scrolls, some approved priestly
weapons, etc. The entrance to the Temple is a `4'.
.IP "The Alchemy shop"
The Alchemy Shop deals in all manner of potions and scrolls.
The entrance to the Alchemy Shop is a `5'.
.IP "The Magic User\'s Shop"
The Magic User's Shop is the most expensive of all the
stores. It deals in all sorts of rings, wands, amulets, and
staves. The entrance to the Magic Shop is a `6'.

.NH 2
Within The Dungeon
.LP
Once your character is adequately supplied with food, light,
armor, and weapons, he is ready to enter the dungeon. Move on
top of the `>' symbol and use the down `>' command. Your
character enters a maze of interconnecting staircases and finally
passes through a one-way door. He is now on the first level of
the dungeon (50 feet), and must survive many horrible and
challenging encounters to find the treasure lying about.

.NH 3
Light
.LP
There are two sources for light once inside the dungeon.
Permanent light which has been magically placed within rooms, and
a light source carried by the player. If neither is present, the
character will be unable to map or see any attackers. Lack of
light will also affect searching, picking locks, and disarming.
.LP
A character must wield a torch or lamp in order to supply
his own light. Once a torch or lamp has only 50 or less turns
left before burning out, the message \*QYour light is getting low\*U
will be displayed at random intervals. Once a torch is burnt
out, it is useless and can be dropped. A lamp or lantern can be
refilled with oil by using the Fill `F' command. You must of
course be carrying extra oil to refill a lantern.

.NH 3
Attacking And Being Attacked
.LP
Attacking is simple in \fImoria\fP. If you move into a creature,
you attack him. You can attack from a distance by firing a
missile, or by magical means such as aiming a wand. Creatures
attack in the same way, if they move into you, they attack you.
Some creatures can cast spells from a distance, and dragon type
creatures can breath from a distance, but these are the only
exceptions.
.LP
If you are wielding a weapon, the damage for the weapon is
used when you hit the creature. If you are wielding no weapons,
you get two fist strikes. Note that very strong creatures can do
a lot of damage with their fists... A character may have a
primary and secondary weapon. A secondary weapon is kept on the
belt, or on the shoulder for immediate use. You can switch
between your primary and secondary weapons by using the exchange
command. Be sure you are wielding the proper weapon when
fighting. Hitting a dragon over the head with a bow will simply
make him mad, and get you killed.
.LP
Missile weapons, such as bows, can be wielded, and then the
proper missile, in this case an arrow, can be fired across the
room into a target. Missiles can be used without the proper
missile weapon, but used together they have a greater range and
do far more damage.
.LP
Hits and misses are determined by ability to hit vs. armor
class. A miss doesn't necessarily mean you failed to hit the
target, but only that you failed to do any damage. Therefore
a `hit' is a strike that does some damage. Higher armor classes
make it harder to do damage, therefore more misses.

.NH 4
Your Weapon
.LP
Carrying a weapon in your backpack does you no good. You
must wield a weapon before it can be used in a fight. Note that
a secondary weapon can be kept by wielding it and then using the
exchange command. A secondary weapon is not in use, simply
ready to be switched with the current weapon if needed.
.LP
Weapons have two main characteristics, their ability to hit
and their ability to do damage, expressed as `(+ ,+ )'. A normal
weapon would be `(+0,+0)'. Many weapons in \fImoria\fP have magical
bonuses to hit and/or do damage. Some weapons are cursed, and
have penalties that hurt the player. Note that cursed swords
cannot be un-wielded until the curse is lifted.
.LP
Missile weapons, such as bows, have only one major
characteristic which is to hit, expressed `(+ )'. This plus to
hit is added to that of the missile used, if the proper
weapon/missiles combination are used.
.LP
Although you receive any magical bonuses an unidentified
weapon may possess when you wield it, those bonuses will not be
added in to the displayed values of to-hit and to-dam on your
character sheet. You must identify the weapon before the
displayed values reflect the real values used.
.LP
Finally, some rare weapons have special abilities. These are
called ego weapons, and are feared by great and meek. An ego
sword must be wielded to receive benefit of its abilities.
.LP
Special weapons are denoted by the following abbreviations:
.IP "DF - Defender."
A magical weapon that actually helps the wielder defend
himself, thus increasing his/her armor class.
.IP "FB - Frost Brand."
A magical weapon of ice that delivers a cold critical to
heat based creatures.
.IP "FT - Flame Tongue."
A magical weapon of flame that delivers a heat critical
to cold based creatures.
.IP "HA - Holy Avenger."
A Holy Avenger is by far the most powerful of weapons.
Holy Avengers have been known to increase several of the
wielder's stats, to actually increase the wielder's armor
class (because of the terror the weapon spawns in its foes),
and to actually help the wielder to fight more effectively.
.IP "SD - Slay Dragon."
A Slay Dragon weapon is a special purpose weapon whose
sole intent is to destroy dragon-kind. Therefore, when used
against a dragon, the amount of damage done is greatly
increased.
.IP "SE - Slay Evil."
A Slay Evil weapon is a special purpose weapon whose
sole intent is to destroy all forms of evil. When used
against an evil creature, either alive or undead, the damage
done is greatly increased.
.IP "SM - Slay Monster."
A Slay Monster weapon is a special purpose weapon whose
sole intent is to destroy all the vile monsters of the world.
A monster is any creature not natural to the world.
Therefore an orc would be a monster, but a giant snake would
not be.
.IP "SU - Slay Undead."
A Slay Undead weapon is a special purpose weapon whose
sole intent is to destroy all forms of undead. This weapon
is hated and feared by the intelligent undead, for a single
blow from this weapon is capable of destroying them.

.NH 4
Body And Shield Bashes
.LP
Weight is the primary factor in being able to bash
something, but strength plays a role too. After bashing, a
character may be off balance for several rounds depending upon
his dexterity.
.LP
Doors can be broken down by bashing them. Once a door is
bashed open, it is forever useless and cannot be closed.
.LP
Chests too may be bashed open, but be warned that the
careless smashing of a chest often ruins the contents. Bashing
open a chest will not disarm any traps it may contain, but does
allow the strong and ignorant to see what is inside.
.LP
Finally, a creature may be bashed. If a shield is currently
being worn, the bash is a shield bash and will do more damage.
In either case, a bash may throw an opponent off balance for a
number of rounds, allowing a player to get in a free hit or more.
If the player is thrown off-balance, his opponent may get free
hits on him. This is a risky attack.

.NH 4
Your Armor Class
.LP
Armor class is a number that describes the amount and the
quality of armor being worn. Armor class will generally run from
about 0 to 40, but could become negative or greater than 40 in
rare cases.
.LP
The larger your armor class, the more protective it is. A
negative armor class would actually help get you hit. Armor
protects you in three manners. One, it makes you harder to be
hit for damage. A hit for no damage is the same as a miss. Two,
good armor will absorb some of the damage that your character
would have taken. An armor class of 30 would absorb 30% of any
damage meant for him. Three, fire and acid damage are reduced by
wearing body armor. It is obvious that a high armor class is a
must for surviving the lower levels of \fImoria\fP.
.LP
Each piece of armor has an armor class adjustment, and a
magical bonus. Armor bought in town will have these values
displayed with their description. Armor that is found within the
dungeon must be identified before these values will be displayed.
Armor class values are always displayed between a set of
brackets `[ ,+ ]'. The first value is the armor class of the item. The
second number is the magical bonus of the item, and will always
have a sign preceding the value. There are a few cases where the
form `[+ ]' is used, meaning the object has no armor class, only
a magical armor bonus if worn.
.LP
Some pieces of armor will possess special abilities denoted
by the following abbreviations:
.IP "RA - Resist Acid."
This magical ability is usually enchanted into armor,
but may occasionally be found as an ability of a weapon. A
character using such an object will take only quarter
damage from any acid thrown upon him. In addition, armor so
enchanted will resist the acid's effects and not be damaged
by it.
.IP "RC - Resist Cold."
This magical ability is also found in both weapons and
armor. A character using a resist cold object will take only
one third damage from frost and cold.
.IP "RF - Resist Fire."
This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.
A character using a resist fire object will take only one
third damage from heat and fire.
.IP "RL - Resist Lightning."
This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.
A character using a resist lightning object will take only
one third damage from electrical attacks.
.IP "R - Resistance."
This magical ability is found only in armor. A
character wearing armor with this ability will have
resistance to Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning as explained in
each part above.

.NH 3
Objects Found In The Dungeon
.LP
The mines are full of objects just waiting to be picked up
and used. How did they get there? Well, the main source for
useful items are all the foolish adventurers that proceeded into
the dungeon before you. They get killed, and the helpful
monsters scatter the various treasure throughout the dungeon.
Most cursed items are placed there by the joyful evil sorcerers,
who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.
.LP
You pick up objects by moving on top of them. You can carry
up to 22 different items in your backpack while wearing and
wielding many others. Note that although you are limited to 22
different items, you may be carrying several of each item
restricted only by the amount of weight your character can carry.
Your character's weight limit is determined by his strength.
Only one object may occupy any one given floor location, which
may or may not also contain one monster. Note that doors, traps,
and staircases are considered objects for this purpose.
.LP
Many objects found within the dungeon have special commands
for their use. Wands must be Aimed, staves must be Used, scrolls
must be Read, and potions must be Quaffed. In any case, you must
first be able to carry an object before you can use it. Some
objects, such as chests, are very complex. Chests contain other
objects and may be trapped, and/or locked. Read the list of
player commands carefully for a further understanding of chests.
.LP
One item in particular will be discussed here. The scroll
of \*QWord of Recall\*U can be found within the dungeon, or bought at
the temple in town. It acts in two manners, depending upon your
current location. If read within the dungeon, it will teleport
you back to town. If read in town, it will teleport you back
down to the deepest level of the dungeon one which your character
has previously been. This makes the scroll very useful for
getting back to the deeper levels of \fImoria\fP. Once the scroll has
been read it takes a while for the spell to act, so don't expect
it to save you in a crisis.
.LP
And lastly, a final warning. Not all objects are what they
seem. Skeletons lying peacefully about the dungeon have been
known to get up...

.NH 3
Cursed Objects
.LP
Some objects, mainly armor and weapons, have had curses laid
upon them. These horrible objects will look like any other
normal item, but will detract from your character's stats or
abilities if worn. They will also be impossible to remove until
a remove curse is done.
.LP
When a cursed item has been identified, an asterisk `*' will
appear next to the inventory letter of the item. If you should
wear a cursed item, you will immediately know it is cursed and
again the asterisk will appear.

.NH 3
Mining
.LP
Much of the treasure within the dungeon can be found only by
mining it out of the walls. Many rich strikes exist within each
level, but must be found and mined. Quartz veins are the
richest, yielding the most metals and gems, but magma veins will
have some hordes hidden within.
.LP
Mining is virtually impossible without a pick or shovel.
Picks and shovels have an additional magical ability expressed as `(+ )'.
The higher the number, the better the magical digging
ability of the tool. Note that a pick or shovel also has pluses
to hit and damage, and can be used as a weapon.
.LP
When a vein of quartz or magma is located, the character
should wield his pick or shovel and begin digging out a section.
When that section is removed, he should locate another section of
the vein, and begin the process again. Since granite rock is
much harder to dig through, it is much faster to follow the vein
exactly and dig around the granite.
.LP
If the character has a scroll or staff of treasure location,
he can immediately locate all strikes of treasure within a vein
shown on the screen. This makes mining much easier and more
profitable.

.NH 3
Staircases
.LP
Staircases are the manner in which you get deeper, or climb
out of the dungeon. The symbols for the up and down staircases
are the same as the commands to use them. A `<' represents an up
staircase and a `>' represents a down staircase. You must move
your character over the staircase before you can use them.
.LP
Each level has at least one up staircase, and at least two
down staircases. There are no exceptions to this rule. You may
have trouble finding some well hidden secret doors, but the
stairs are there.

.NH 3
Secret Doors, Passages, And Rooms
.LP
Many secret doors are used within the dungeon to confuse and
demoralize adventurers foolish enough to enter. But with some
luck, and lots of concentration, you can find these secret doors.
.LP
Secret doors will sometimes hide rooms or corridors, or even
entire sections of that level of the dungeon. Sometimes they
simply hide small empty closets or even dead ends.
.LP
Creatures in the dungeon will generally know and use this
secret doors. If they leave one open, you will be able to go
right through it. If they close it behind them you will have to
search for the catch first. Once a secret door has been
discovered by you, it is drawn as a known door and no more
searching will be required to use it.

.NH 3
Winning The Game
.LP
Once your character has progressed into killing dragons with
but a mean glance and snap of his fingers, he may be ready to
take on the Balrog. The Balrog will appear on every level after
level 49, so don't go down there until you are ready for him.
.LP
The Balrog cannot be killed in some of the easier methods
used on normal creatures. Because of the Balrog's cunning, he
will teleport away to another level if a spell such as genocide
is used upon him, and the Balrog cannot be polymorphed, slept, or
charmed. Magical spells like coldball are effective against him
as are weapons, but he is difficult to kill and if allowed to
escape for a time can heal himself.
.LP
If you should actually survive the attempt of killing the
Balrog, you will receive the status of WINNER. Since you have
defeated the toughest monster alive, your character is ready to
retire and cannot be saved. When you quit the game, your
character receives a surprise bonus score and is entered into the
toptwenty file.

.NH 3
Upon Death And Dying
.LP
If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died and
cannot be restored. A tombstone showing information about your
character will be displayed with the option to print the
information to a file.
.LP
After the tombstone, the toptwenty list of heroes is
displayed. If your score beats any of the toptwenty, your
character will join this elite rank of heroes. Otherwise, well,
there is always next time...

.NH 3
Wizards
.LP
There are rumors of \fImoria\fP Wizards which, if asked nicely,
can explain details of the \fImoria\fP game that seem complicated to
beginners. In addition, they have special spells which can
restore characters lost by accident, such as power-outs and such.
