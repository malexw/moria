NAME
     moria - Dungeon Adventure

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/moria [ -ros ] [ _s_a_v_e__f_i_l_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     The game of _m_o_r_i_a is a single player dungeon simulation.   A
     player  may  choose  from  a  number  of  races  and classes
     when creating their character, and then 'run' that  charac-
     ter  over  a period of days, weeks, even months; attempting
     to win the game by defeating the Balrog which lurks in the
     deeper levels.

     The player will begin his adventure on the town level  where
     he  may  acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical dev-
     ices by bartering with various shop  owners.   After
     preparing  for  his adventure,  the  player  can  descend
     into the dungeons of _m_o_r_i_a where fantastic adventures await
     his coming!

     To get started you really only need to know two commands.
     The command ? will give you a list of the available commands
     (below).  The / command will identify the objects you see on
     the screen.  Before beginning your first adventure, you
     should also read _T_h_e _D_u_n_g_e_o_n_s _o_f _M_O_R_I_A document carefully.
     The game of _m_o_r_i_a is a complicated game, and will require a
     dedicated player to win.

     The -r switch will make the game accept rogue like commands.

     The -o switch will make the game accept original commands
     (this is the default).

     The -s switch will print the scores and then quit.

     If _s_a_v_e__f_i_l_e is specified, _m_o_r_i_a will be restored from the
     specified saved game file.

BUGS
     The SYS V version does not lock the scoreboard, if two
     processes try to modify it at the same time, it may become
     corrupted.

     Wearing an amulet or ring that would raise a stat over
     18/100 actually only raises the stat to 18/100.  When the
     amulet is removed, the stat drops to a value below its ori-
     ginal value.

     Probably infinite (although countably infinite).
