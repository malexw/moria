          _1.  _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n

          The game of _m_o_r_i_a is  a  single  player  dungeon  simulation.   A
          player  may choose from a number of races and classes when creat-
          ing a character, and then `run' that character over a  period  of
          days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by defeating
          the Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels.

          The player will begin his adventure on the town  level  where  he
          may acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bar-
          tering with various shop owners.  After preparing for his  adven-
          ture,  the  player  can  descend into the dungeons of _m_o_r_i_a where
          fantastic adventures await his coming!

          Before beginning your first adventure, you should read this docu-
          ment  carefully.   The  game  of _m_o_r_i_a is a complicated game, and
          will require a dedicated player to win.


          _2.  _T_h_e _C_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r

          All characters have six main attributes which modify their  basic
          abilities.   These  six  attributes,  called _s_t_a_t_s, are _s_t_r_e_n_g_t_h,
          _i_n_t_e_l_l_i_g_e_n_c_e,  _w_i_s_d_o_m,  _d_e_x_t_e_r_i_t_y,  _c_o_n_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n,  and  _c_h_a_r_i_s_m_a.
          Stats  may  vary  from  3  as  a  minimum to 18/100 as a maximum.
          Because adventurers of interest tend to be  better  than  average
          characters,  _m_o_r_i_a stats will average about 12.5, and are further
          adjusted by race and class.  Some races are just naturally better
          at being certain classes, as will be shown later.

          In addition to the more visible stats, each character has certain
          abilities  which are mainly determined by his race and class, but
          are also modified by his  stats.   The  abilities  are  _f_i_g_h_t_i_n_g,
          _t_h_r_o_w_i_n_g/_b_o_w_s, _s_a_v_i_n_g _t_h_r_o_w, _s_t_e_a_l_t_h, _d_i_s_a_r_m_i_n_g, _m_a_g_i_c_a_l _d_e_v_i_c_e_s,
          _p_e_r_c_e_p_t_i_o_n, _s_e_a_r_c_h_i_n_g, and _i_n_f_r_a-_v_i_s_i_o_n.

          Characters will be assigned an early history, with  money  and  a
          social  class  based on that history.  Starting money is assigned
          based on history, charisma, and somewhat upon the  average  of  a
          character's  stats.   A  character  with below average stats will
          receive extra money to help him survive the first adventure.

          Each character will also have physical attributes such as a race,

          a  height,  weight,  sex,  and  a  physical description.  None of
          these, except weight, play any part in the  game  other  than  to
          give  the  player  a "feeling" for his character.  Weight is used
          for computing carrying capacity and also for _b_a_s_h_i_n_g.

          Finally each character is assigned  _h_i_t  _p_o_i_n_t_s  based  on  their
          race,  class,  and constitution.  Spell casters will also receive
          _m_a_n_a which is expended when casting spells.   Mana  is  based  on
          Wisdom for Priests and Intelligence for Mages.


          _2._1.  _C_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _S_t_a_t_s

          Strength
               Strength is important in fighting with weapons, or  hand  to
               hand.   A high strength can improve your chances of hitting,
               and the amount of damage done  with  each  hit.   Characters
               with  low strengths may receive penalties.  Strength is also
               useful in tunneling, body and shield bashing, and in  carry-
               ing heavy items.

          Intelligence
               Intelligence is the prime stat of a mage,  or  magician.   A
               high  intelligence  increases  a  mage's chances of learning
               spells, and in gaining mana.  No spell  may  be  learned  by
               mages  with  intelligences under 8.  Intelligence also modi-
               fies a character's chance of  disarming  traps  and  picking
               locks.

          Wisdom
               Wisdom is the  prime  stat  of  a  priest.   A  high  wisdom
               increases the chance of receiving new spells from a priest's
               diety, and in the gaining of mana.  Wisdom also  modifies  a
               character's chance of resisting magical spells cast upon his
               person.

          Dexterity
               Dexterity is the combination of agility  and  quickness.   A
               high  dexterity  may allow a character to get multiple blows
               with lighter  weapons,  thus  greatly  increasing  his  kill
               power,  and  may  increase  his  chances of hitting with any
               weapon.  Dexterity is  also  useful  in  picking  locks  and
               disarming traps.

          Constitution
               Constitution is a character's ability to  resist  damage  to
               their  body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore
               a character with a high constitution will receive  more  hit
               points, and be more resistant to poisons.

          Charisma
               Charisma represents a character's personality,  as  well  as
               physical  looks.   A  character  with  a  high charisma will
               receive better prices from store owners, whereas a character

          The Dungeons of Moria                                 Page 3


               with  a  very  low  charisma  will  be robbed blind.  A high
               charisma will also mean more starting money for the  charac-
               ter.


          _2._2.  _C_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _S_e_x

          You may choose to be either a male or a female  character.   Only
          height  and  weight  are  affected  by a character's sex.  Female
          characters tend to be somewhat smaller  and  lighter  then  their
          male counterparts.  No adjustments to stats or abilities are made
          because of the sex of a character.


          _2._3.  _C_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _A_b_i_l_i_t_i_e_s

          Characters possess nine different abilities which can  help  them
          to  survive. The starting abilities of a character are based upon
          race and class. Abilities may be adjusted by high or  low  stats,
          and may increase with the level of the character.

          Fighting
               Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
               fists.  Normally  a  character  gets  a single blow from any
               weapon, but if his dexterity and strength are  high  enough,
               he  may  receive  more blows per round with lighter weapons.
               Strength and dexterity both modify the  ability  to  hit  an
               opponent. In addition this skill increases with the level of
               the character.

          Throwing/Bows
               Using stand-off missile  weapons  and  throwing  objects  is
               included  in  this skill. Different stats apply to different
               weapons,  but  may  modify  the  distance   an   object   is
               thrown/fired,  the amount of damage done, and the ability to
               hit a creature.  This skill increases with the level of  the
               character.

          Saving Throw
               A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to  resist  the
               effects  of  a spell cast on him by another person/creature.
               Note that this does not include spells cast on the player by
               his  own  stupidity,  such  as quaffing a nasty potion. This
               ability increases with the level of the character, but  then
               most  high  level creatures are better at casting spells, so
               it tends to even out.

          Stealth
               The ability to move silently about is very useful.   Charac-
               ters with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents,
               gaining the first blow. Also, creatures may fail to notice a
               stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid cer-
               tain fights.

          Disarming
               Disarming is the  ability  to  remove  traps  (safely),  and
               includes  picking locks on traps and doors. Note that a suc-
               cessful disarming will gain the character  some  experience.
               The  character  must  have  found  a  trap  before it can be
               disarmed.  Dexterity and intelligence both modify the  abil-
               ity  to disarm, and this ability increases with the level of
               the character.

          Using Magical Devices
               Using a magical device such as  a  wand  or  staff  requires
               experience and knowledge. Spell users such as mages and pri-
               ests are therefore much better at  using  a  magical  device
               than  say a fighter. This skill is modified by intelligence,
               and increases with the level of the character.

          Perception
               Perception  is  the  ability  to  notice  something  without
               actively  seeking  it out. This skill is based entirely upon
               race and class, and  will  never  improve  unless  magically
               enhanced.

          Searching
               To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
               and  traps  on chests. Rogues are the best at searching, but
               mages, rangers, and priests are also good  at  it.  Intelli-
               gence modifies your searching ability, and your ability will
               also increase with your level.

          Infra Vision
               Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources. Since  most
               of  the dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow
               the player to see walls and objects. Infra-vision will allow
               a  character  to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a cer-
               tain distance. This ability works equally well with or  with
               out  a  light  source.  Note  that  the  majority of _m_o_r_i_a's
               creatures are cold blooded, and will not be detected  unless
               lit up by a light source.


          _2._4.  _C_h_o_o_s_i_n_g _A _R_a_c_e

          There are eight different races  that  you  can  choose  from  in
          _m_o_r_i_a.  Some  races are restricted as to what profession they may
          be, and each race has its own adjustments to a character's  stats
          and abilities.

          Human
               The human is the base character, all other  races  are  com-
               pared  to  him. Humans can choose any class, and are average
               at everything. Humans tend to go up levels faster  than  any
               other  race,  because of their shorter life-spans. No racial
               adjustments occur to characters choosing human.

          The Dungeons of Moria                                 Page 5


          Half-Elf
               Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a  human,  but
               not  as strong. Half-elves are slightly better at searching,
               disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but they are  not
               as good at hand weapons. Half-elves may choose any class.

          Elf
               Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as  good  at
               fighting.  They  tend  to  be smarter and faster than either
               humans or half-elves, and also have better wisdom. Elves are
               better  at  searching,  disarming,  perception, stealth, and
               magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.  Elves  may
               choose any class except Paladin.

          Halfling
               Halflings, or Hobbits, are very good at bows, throwing,  and
               have  good saving throws. They also are very good at search-
               ing, disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excel-
               lent  thieves  (but  prefer  to be called burglars...). They
               will be much weaker than humans, and  no  good  at  bashing.
               Halflings   have  fair  infra-vision,  so  can  detect  warm
               creatures at a distance.  Halflings can choose between being
               a fighter, mage, or rogue.

          Gnome
               Gnomes are smaller than dwarfs, but larger  than  halflings.
               They,  like  the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like
               homes.  Gnomes are practical jokers, so  if  they  can  kill
               something in a humorous way, so much the better. Gnomes make
               excellent mages, and have very good saving throws. They  are
               good  at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They
               have lower strength than humans so they are not very good at
               fighting  with  hand weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision,
               so can detect warm creatures at  a  distance.  A  gnome  may
               choose between being a fighter, mage, priest, or rogue.

          Dwarf
               Dwarves are the headstrong miners and  fighters  of  legend.
               Since  dungeons  are  the  natural home of a dwarf, they are
               excellent choices for a warrior or priest. Dwarves  tend  to
               be  stronger,  have higher constitutions, but are slower and
               less intelligent than humans. Because they are so headstrong
               and  are somewhat wise, they resist spells which are cast on
               them.  Dwarves also have good infra-vision because they live
               underground.  They do have one big draw-back though. Dwarves
               are loud-mouthed and proud, singing in loud voices,  arguing
               with themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges
               at imagined foes. In other words, dwarves have  a  miserable
               stealth.

          Half-Orc
               Half-Orcs make excellent fighters, and decent  priests,  but
               are  terrible  at  magic.  They  are  as  bad  as dwarves at
               stealth,  and  horrible   at   searching,   disarming,   and



          Copyright                                Robert Alan Koeneke





          The Dungeons of Moria                                 Page 6


               perception. Half-Orcs are, let's face it, ugly. They tend to
               pay more for goods in town. Half-Orcs do make  good  priests
               and  rogues,  for  the  simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to
               have great constitutions and lots of hit points.

          Half-Troll
               Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have the highest  hit
               points  of any character race. They are also very stupid and
               slow. They will make great fighters and iffy  priests.  They
               are  bad  at  searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.
               They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence.
               They also happen to be fun to run...

          Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.  Some
          classes  will  not  be available to certain races, for instance a
          Half-Troll cannot become a Paladin. For the first few  adventures
          it  is  suggested that you run a warrior or rogue.  Spell casting

          generally requires a more experienced  player  that  is  familiar
          with survival techniques.

          Warrior
               A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most  of
               his  problems  by cutting them to pieces, but will occasion-
               ally fall back on the help of a magical  device.  His  prime
               stats  are  Strength  and Constitution, and a good Dexterity
               can really help at times. A Warrior will be good at Fighting
               and Throwing/Bows, but bad at most other skills.

          Mage
               A Mage must live by his wits. He cannot hope to simply  hack
               his  way  through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his
               magic to defeat, deceive, confuse, and  to  escape  with.  A
               mage  is  not really complete without a golf-cart of magical
               devices to use in addition to his spells. He can master  the
               higher  level  magical  devices far easier than anyone else,
               and has the best saving throw to resist  effects  of  spells
               cast  at  him.  Intelligence  and  Dexterity are his primary
               stats. There is no rule that says a  mage  cannot  become  a
               good fighter, but spells are his true realm.

          Priest
               A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They  explore  the
               dungeon  only  to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if
               treasure just happens to fall into  their  packs,  well,  so
               much  more  to  the  glory  of their church! Priests receive
               their spells from a diety, and therefore do not choose which
               spells they will learn. He is familiar with magical devices,
               preferring to call them instruments of god, but  is  not  as
               good  as  a  mage  in  their  use.  Priests have good saving
               throws, and make decent fighters, preferring  blunt  weapons
               over  edged  ones. Wisdom and Charisma are the priest's pri-
               mary stats.

          Rogue
               A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his  cunning,
               but  is  capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot. He
               is the master of traps and locks, no device being impossible
               for  him  to  over-come. A rogue has a high stealth allowing
               him to sneak around many creatures without having to  fight,
               or  sneak up and get the first blow. A rogue's perception is
               higher than any other class, and many times he will notice a
               trap  or  secret  door  before  having to search. A rogue is
               better than warriors or paladins with magical  devices,  but
               still  can  not rely on their performance. A rogue's primary
               stats are Intelligence and Dexterity.

          Ranger
               A Ranger is a fighter/mage. He is a good  fighter,  and  the
               best of the classes with a missile weapon such as a bow. The
               ranger learns spells much more slowly than a  mage,  but  is
               capable of learning all but the most powerful spell. Because

          The Dungeons of Moria                                 Page 8


               a ranger is really a dual class character, it requires  more
               experience to advance him. A ranger has a good stealth, good
               perception, good searching, a good saving throw, and is good
               with  magical  devices.   His primary stats are Intelligence
               and Dexterity.

          Paladin
               A Paladin is a fighter/priest. He is a  very  good  fighter,
               second  only to the warrior class, but not very good at mis-
               sile weapons. He receives prayers at a slower pace then  the
               priest,  and  can  receive all but the most powerful prayer.
               Because a paladin is  really  a  dual  class  character,  it
               requires  more  experience  to  advance him. A paladin lacks
               much in the way of abilities. He is poor at stealth, percep-
               tion, searching, and magical devices. He has a decent saving
               throw due to his divine  alliance.  His  primary  stats  are
               Strength and Charisma.

          After you have created your character, you will begin your  _m_o_r_i_a
          adventure.  Symbols  appearing  on your screen will represent the
          dungeon's walls and floor, objects and  features,  and  creatures
          lurking  about.  In  order  to  direct your character through his
          adventure, you will enter single character commands.

          _M_o_r_i_a symbols and commands each have a help  section  devoted  to
          them.  You  should  review  these  sections  before attempting an
          adventure. Finally, a description of the town level and some gen-
          eral help on adventuring are included.

          Symbols on your map can be broken  down  into  three  categories:
          Features  of  the dungeon such as walls, floor, doors, and traps;
          Objects which can be picked up such as treasure, weapons, magical
          devices,  etc;  and  Monsters which may or may not move about the
          dungeon, but are mostly harmful to your character's well being.

          Note that some symbols can be in more than  one  category.   Also
          note  that  treasure may be imbedded in a wall, and the wall must
          be removed before the treasure can be picked up.

          It will not be necessary to remember all of the symbols and their
          meanings.  A simple command, the `/', will identify any character
          appearing on your map. See the section on  commands  for  further
          help.

          All commands are entered by pressing a  single  key,  or  control
          sequence  (holding down the control key while pressing a key). If

          a particular command  requires  additional  action,  it  will  be
          prompted  for,  with one exception. When a direction is required,
          no prompt is given unless and until an illegal response is given.

          For each command, the  characters  used  by  the  original  style
          option  are  listed first, followed by the characters used by the
          rogue-like option in braces, if different.


          _3._2._1.  _N_o_t_e _O_n <_D_i_r>

          For the original style option, in the following instructions, the
          symbol  <Dir> refers to a numeric direction based on your keypad.
          For the rogue-like option, the symbol <Dir> refers to one of  the
          following  letters `hykulnjb', or to a numeric direction based on
          your keypad.  It is not valid to use the number `5' in this  con-
          text.  One  exception to this is with movement, in which case `5'
          will rest the character for one turn.  For the rogue-like option,
          `.' will also rest the character for one turn.

          Commands which require a direction will not prompt you  for  one,
          unless  you  input  an  illegal direction. Just enter a direction
          after the entering the command.

          For the original style option, movement is accomplished by  using
          your  numeric  keypad.   Simply press a number and your character
          will move one step in that direction.  For the rogue-like option,
          movement  is  accomplished by using the numeric keypad, or one of
          the directional characters mentioned above.  Pressing  a  `5'  is
          equivalent  to waiting for one round (More efficient resting over
          long periods of time is accomplished by using the Rest  command).
          You  can only move onto and through floor spots, and only if they

          contain no creatures or obstructing  objects  such  as  a  closed
          door.

          Moving your character one step at a time can  be  time  consuming
          and boring, so a faster method has been supplied.  For the origi-
          nal style option, by using the Move command `.', you may move  in
          a direction until something interesting happens. For instance, by
          pressing the period key `.' followed by  the  direction  8,  your
          character  would continue to move up the screen, only coming to a
          stop after at least one condition is satisfied.  For  the  rogue-
          like option, typing a shifted directional letter will move you in
          that direction until something interesting happens.  These  stop-
          ping conditions are:

          [1]  A creature appears upon the screen, or a creature already on
               the screen moves.

          [2]  You move next to an object,  or  feature  such  as  a  door,
               staircase, or trap.

          [3]  You come to a wall, and have more than one choice of  direc-
               tions from which to continue, or are in a dead end passage.

          [4]  You come to a junction of several passages.


          B <Dir> - Bash {f - force}
               The Bash command includes breaking open doors and chests, or
               bashing  an opponent. Two main factors determine the ability
               of a character to bash, their weight and their strength.  In
               addition,  when bashing an opponent, you will either perform
               a body bash, or, if wielding a shield, perform a shield bash
               which is more effective.

               Bashing a door can throw the character off-balance, but this
               will not generally be a problem. Doors that have been jammed
               closed with spikes can only be  opened  by  bashing.  Locked
               doors may also be bashed open. Note that bashing a door open
               will permanently break it.

               Bashing a creature has effects on both the  player  and  his
               opponent.  Depending  on  a character's dexterity, he may or
               may not be thrown off-balance allowing  free  moves  to  his
               opponents.

               If the bash is successful, the opponent will be thrown  off-
               balance  for  1 or 2 turns, thus allowing the character free
               hits or a chance to run.

               A player automatically performs a shield bash instead  of  a
               body  bash,  if  he  is currently wearing a shield. A shield
               bash adds the damage of a shield to that of the bash, so  is
               more  effective. Note that size and material both affect the
               damage that a shield will do.

          C  - Print character (to screen or file)
               This command allows the player to either display his charac-
               ter  on the terminal screen, or to print an entire character
               info listing to a file.  If  printed  to  a  file,  history,
               equipment list, and an inventory list are included.

          D <Dir> - Disarm a trap.
               You can attempt to disarm floor traps,  or  trapped  chests.
               If  you  fail  to  disarm a trap, there is a chance that you
               blunder and set it off. You can only  disarm  a  trap  on  a
               chest after finding it with the search command.

          E  - Eat some food.
               A character must eat occasionally to remain effective. As  a
               character  grows hungry, a message will appear at the bottom
               of the screen saying "Hungry". If a character remains hungry
               long enough, he will become weak and eventually start faint-
               ing.

          F  - Fill a lamp or lantern with oil.
               If your character is currently using a lamp for  light,  and
               if  he  has  a  flask of oil in inventory, he may refill the
               lamp by using this command. A lamp is capable of  a  maximum
               of 5500 turns of light, and each flask has 5000 turns of oil
               contained in it.

          L  - Display map co-ordinates. {W - where}
               The Location command will display your  character's  current
               co-ordinates as shown on a printed map (printed with the `P'
               command). Sectors contain up to 44 rows by 99 columns  each.
               The  Location  command  will display the character's current
               row and column map  co-ordinates,  as  well  as  the  sector
               number.

          P  - Print map to file. {M - map}
               The Print command will write an entire map  of  the  dungeon
               floor  explored to a file. Since the dungeon floor is large,
               the map is broken up into sectors, each containing up to  44
               rows by 99 columns.

          R  - Rest for a number of turns.
               You may rest one turn by pressing the `5' key.  Resting  for
               longer  periods  of  time  is accomplished by using the Rest
               command, followed by the number of turns you  want  to  rest
               your  character.   Resting will continue until the specified
               duration has expired, or something  to  wake  the  character
               happens,  such as a creature wandering by. It is sometimes a
               good idea to rest a beat-up character until he regains  some
               of his hit points, but be sure to have plenty of food if you
               rest often.

               If you have accidently entered in a rest period  too  large,
               or  change  your mind about the resting period, you may wake
               your character up by typing control-C.

          S  - Search mode toggle. {#}
               The Searching toggle will take the character into and out of
               searching  mode. When first pressed, the message "Searching"
               will appear at the bottom of the screen.  The  character  is
               now  taking  two turns for each command, one for the command
               and one turn to search about him. Note that this means he is
               taking  twice the time to move about the dungeon, and there-
               fore twice the food. If  a  creature  should  happen  by  or
               attack  you, search mode will automatically shut off. Other-
               wise you may turn off search mode by again pressing the  `S'
               key.

          T <Dir> - Tunnel through rock. {control-<Dir>}
               Tunneling (Mining) is a very  useful  art.  There  are  four
               kinds  of  rock  present in the dungeons of _m_o_r_i_a: Permanent
               Rock, Granite Rock, Magma Intrusion, and Quartz Veins.  Per-
               manent  Rock  is  exactly  that,  permanent. Granite is very
               hard, therefore hard to dig through, and contains  no  valu-
               able metals. Magma and Quartz veins are softer and sometimes
               bare valuable metals and gems, shown as a `$' or a `*' char-
               acter.  You  can tell if the metal or gems are embedded into
               the wall by trying to move onto them. If you can't move over
               them, you'll have to dig them out.

               Tunneling can be VERY difficult by hand, so when you dig  be
               sure to wield either a shovel or a pick. Magical shovels and
               picks can be found which allow the wielder to dig much  fas-
               ter than normal, and a good strength also helps.

               It is sometimes possible to get a character  trapped  within
               the dungeon by using various magical spells and items. So it
               is a very good idea to always carry  some  kind  of  digging
               tool, even when you are not planning on tunneling for treas-
               ure.

          a <Dir> - Aim a wand. {z - zap}
               Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used. Wands  are  a
               magical device and therefore use the Magical Devices ability
               of  the  player.  They  will   either   affect   the   first
               object/creature  encountered,  or affect anything in a given
               direction, depending upon the wand. An obstruction  such  as
               door  or wall will generally stop the effects of a wand from
               traveling further.

          b  - Browse a book. {P - peruse}
               You can only read a book if you are of its realm.  Therefore
               a  magic  user could read a magic book, but not a holy book.
               Fighters will not be able to read either kind of book.  When
               the  browse  command  is  used, all of the spells or prayers
               contained in the book along with information about it,  such
               as  its level, the amount of mana used up in casting it, and
               whether or not  you  know  the  spell  or  prayer,  will  be
               displayed.  There are a total of 31 different magical spells
               in four books, and 31 different prayers in four books.

          c <Dir> - Close a door.
               Non-intelligent and certain other creatures will not be able
               to  open  a  door.  Therefore  shutting  doors can be a life
               saver.  You must be adjacent to an open door, and you cannot
               close broken doors. Note that bashing a door open will break
               it.

          d  - Drop an object from your inventory.
               You can drop a single object onto the floor beneath  you  if
               that  floor  spot  does  not already contain an object. Note
               that doors and traps are considered objects in  this  sense.
               If  you  drop an object such as a potion or scroll, a single
               one is dropped onto the floor at a time. Group objects  such
               as arrows are all dropped at once onto the floor.

          e  - Display a list of equipment being used.
               Use the Equipment command  to  display  a  list  of  objects
               currently  being  used  by  your  character.  Note that each
               object has a specific place where it  is  placed,  and  that
               only  one  object  of each type may be used at any one time,
               excepting rings of which two can be worn, one on each hand.

          f <Dir> - Fire/Throw an object/Use a missile weapon. {t - throw}
               You may throw any object carried by your character.  Depend-
               ing  upon  the  weight  of an object, it may travel across a
               room or drop down beside you. If you throw an object such as
               an arrow, only one will be used at a time.

               If you throw at a  creature,  your  chance  of  hitting  the
               creature  is  determined by your pluses to hit, your ability
               at throwing, and  the  object's  pluses  to  hit.  Once  the
               creature  is  hit,  the  object may or may not do any actual
               damage to it.  Certain objects in the dungeon can  do  great
               amounts  of  damage  when thrown, but it's for you to figure
               out the obscure ones.  Oil flasks are considered to  be  lit
               before  thrown,  therefore  they  will  do  fire damage to a
               creature if they hit it.

               To use a bow with arrows, simply wield the bow and throw the
               arrows.  Extra  pluses  to  damage and hitting are gained by
               wielding the proper weapon and  throwing  the  corresponding
               ammo.   A  heavy  crossbow  with  bolts  for  example,  is a
               killer...

               The Inventory command displays a list of all  objects  being
               carried,  but are not in current use. You may carry up to 22
               different kinds of objects,  not  including  those  in  your
               equipment  list.  Depending  upon your strength, you will be

               able carry many identical objects before hitting your weight
               limit.

          j <Dir> - Jam a door with an iron spike. {S - spike}
               Most humanoid and many intelligent creatures can simply open
               a closed door, and can eventually get through a locked door.
               Therefore you may spike a door in  order  to  jam  it.  Each
               spike  used on a door will increase its strength. It is very
               easy to jam a door so much as to make it impossible for your
               character  to bash it down, so spike doors wisely. Note that
               the bigger a creature is, the easier  it  can  bash  a  door
               down.  Therefore  four  or more spikes might be necessary to
               slow down a dragon,  where  one  spike  would  slow  down  a
               kobold.

          m  - Cast a magic spell.
               First, a character must have learned a spell before  he  can
               cast  it. Next, when casting a spell, he must read the spell
               from a book, so a book containing the spell must be  in  his
               inventory.   Each spell has a chance of failure which starts
               out fairly large but decreases as a character gains  levels.
               If  a  character  does  not  have  the  available  mana,  he
               increases his chance of failure, and  gambles  on  losing  a
               point of constitution. Note that since a character must read
               the spell from a book, he cannot be blind or  confused  when
               casting a spell, and there must be some light present.

          l <Dir> - Look in a direction. {x - examine}
               The Look command is useful in identifying the exact type  of
               object  or creature shown on the screen. Also, if a creature
               is on top of an object, the look command will describe both.
               You  can  see  creatures and objects up to 200 feet away (20
               units).  Note that you  may  freely  use  the  Look  command
               without the creatures getting a move on you.

          o <Dir> - Open a door, chest, or lock.
               To open an object such as a door or chest you must  use  the
               Open command. If the object is locked, the Open command will
               attempt to pick the lock, based on your ability  at  disarm-
               ing.  Note that if an object is trapped and you open it, the
               trap will be set off.

          p  - Read a prayer.
               First, a character must have learned a prayer before he  can
               read  it. Next, when reading a prayer, he must have the book
               containing the prayer in his inventory. Each  prayer  has  a
               chance   of  failure  which  starts  out  fairly  large  but
               decreases as a character gains levels. If a  character  does
               not  have  the  available  mana,  he increases his chance of
               failure, and gambles on losing a point of constitution. Note
               that  since a character must read the prayer from a book, he
               cannot be blind or confused and there  must  be  some  light
               present.

          q  - Quaff a potion.
               To drink a potion use the Quaff command.  A  potion  affects
               the  player in some manner. The effects of the potion may be
               immediately noticed, or they may be subtle and unnoticed.

          r  - Read a scroll.
               To read a scroll use the Read command. A scroll spell has an
               area  affect, except in a few cases such as identify scrolls
               which act on other objects. Note that two scrolls, the iden-
               tify  scroll  and the recharge scroll, have titles which can
               be read without setting them off, and by  pressing  <ESCAPE>
               can be saved for future use.

          s  - Search general area one turn.
               The Search command can be used to locate  hidden  traps  and
               secret  doors about the player. Note that more than a single
               turn of searching will be required in most cases. You should
               always  search a chest before trying to open it because they
               are generally trapped.

          t  - Take off a piece of equipment. {T}
               Use the Take-Off command to remove an object from  use,  and
               return  it to your inventory. Occasionally you will run into
               a cursed item which cannot  be  removed.  Cursed  items  are
               always  bad,  and  can  only be taken off after removing the
               curse.

          u  - Use a staff. {Z - Zap}
               The Use command will activate a staff.  Like  scrolls,  most
               staffs  have  an  area  affect. Because staffs are generally
               more powerful than most other items, they are also harder to
               use correctly.

          v  - Display current version of game.
               The Version command displays the  credits  for  the  current
               version of _m_o_r_i_a.

          w  - Wear or wield an item being carried.
               To wear or wield  an  object  in  your  inventory,  use  the
               Wear/Wield  command.  If an object is already in use for the
               same function, it is automatically removed first. Note  that
               an  object's  bonuses  cannot  be gained until it is worn or
               wielded.

          x  - Exchange primary and secondary weapons. {X}
               A secondary weapon is any weapon which may be needed  often.
               Instead of searching through your inventory, you may use the
               exchange command to keep the weapon ready. For instance,  if
               you  wanted  to  use your bow most of the time, but needed a
               sword for close combat, you could wield your sword, use  the
               exchange command to make it the secondary weapon, then wield
               your bow. If the sword was suddenly needed, simply  use  the
               exchange command to switch between the bow and the sword.

          /  - Identify a character shown on screen.
               Use the identify  command  to  find  out  what  a  character
               displayed  on the screen stands for. For instance, by press-
               ing `/.', you can find out that the `.' stands for  a  floor
               spot.   When used with a creature, the identify command will
               tell you only what class of creature the symbol stands  for,
               not  the  specific  creature, therefore use the look command
               for this information.

          ?  - Display a list of commands.
               The ? command displays a one page quick reference help  page
               on the screen.

          ^P  - Repeat last message.
               The <Control>-P command will  re-display  the  last  message
               printed  on the message line at the top of your screen.  You
               can read the last twenty messages by repeatedly typing ^P.

          ^R  - Redraw the screen.
               To redraw the entire screen, use the <Control>-R command.

          ^K  - Quit the game without saving. {Q}
               To exit the game without saving your  character  (i.e.  kill
               him/her)  use  the  <Control>-K command. Once exited in this
               manner, your character is non-recoverable.

          ^X  - Save your character and exit the game.
               To save your game so that it can be restarted later, use the
               <Control>-X command. The save file cannot be moved, or read.
               Do not try to tamper with it.  Note that a copy of  a  saved
               character will not work after that character has died.

          $  - Shell out of game. {!}
               Use the Shell command `$' to temporarily exit  the  game  to
               execute  UNIX  commands. You may re-enter the game by typing
               exit to end the spawned process.

          <  - Go up an up-staircase.
               If you move onto an up-staircase you may use the `<' command
               to  go  up one level. There is always one staircase going up
               on every level except for the town level (this does not mean
               it's  easy  to  find). Going up a staircase will always take
               you to a new dungeon area except for the town  level,  which
               remains the same for the duration of your character.

          >  - Go down a down-staircase.
               If you are on top of a down-staircase you may  use  the  `>'
               command  to go down one level. There are always two or three
               staircases going down on each level, except the  town  level
               which has only one. Going down will always take you to a new
               dungeon area.

          . <Dir> - Move in direction. {shift<Dir>}
               The  Move  command  `.'  will  move  you  in  the  indicated

               ditions include: a  creature  appearing  on  the  screen,  a
               creature  already on the screen moving, an object or feature
               such as a door, a staircase, or a trap is  adjacent  to  the
               character,  character  comes into a junction of passages, or
               character comes to a wall with no choice or  more  than  one
               choice of continuing directions.

          The town level is where you will begin your adventure.  The  town
          consists of six buildings each with an entrance, some towns `peo-
          ple', and a wall which surrounds the town. The first time you are
          in town it will be daytime, but you may return to find that dark-
          ness has fallen. (Note that some spells may  act  differently  in
          the town level.)


          _3._3._1.  _T_o_w_n_s_p_e_o_p_l_e

          The town contains many different kinds of people. There  are  the
          street  urchins,  young  children  who will mob an adventurer for
          money, and seem  to  come  out  of  the  woodwork  when  excited.
          Blubbering  Idiots  are  a  constant  annoyance, but not harmful.
          Public drunks wander about the town singing, and are of no threat
          to  anyone. Sneaky rogues hang about watching for a likely victim
          to mug. And finally, what town would be complete without a  swarm
          of  half  drunk warriors, who take offense or become annoyed just
          for the fun of it.

          Most of the towns people should be avoided by the largest  possi-

          break out though, so be prepared. Since your character grew up in
          this  world  of intrigue, no experience is awarded for killing on
          the town level.

          Your character  will  begin  his  adventure  with  some  supplies
          already on him. Use the Inventory `i' command to check what these
          supplies are. It will be necessary to buy other  supplies  before
          continuing into the dungeon, however, so be sure to enter each of
          the stores.


          _3._3._3.  _T_o_w_n _B_u_i_l_d_i_n_g_s

          You may enter any of the stores, if they  are  open,  and  barter
          with  the  owner for items you can afford. But be warned that the
          owners can easily be insulted, and may even throw you out  for  a
          while if you insult them too often. To enter a store, simply move
          onto the entrance represented by the numbers 1 through 6.

          Once inside a store, his inventory  will  appear  on  the  screen
          along  with  a  set of options for your character. You may browse
          the store's inventory if it takes more than one page to  display,
          and you may sell or purchase items in his inventory. You can exe-
          cute your inventory and equipment commands to see  what  you  are
          carrying.  Not shown with the options are the wear, take-off, and
          exchange commands which will also work, but were excluded to keep
          the options simple.

          Stores do not always  have  everything  in  stock.  As  the  game
          progresses,  they  may  get new items so check from time to time.
          Also, if you sell them an item, it may get  sold  to  a  customer
          while  you  are  adventuring so don't always expect to be able to
          get back anything you have sold.

          Store owners will not buy harmful or useless items. If an  object
          is  unidentified, they will pay you some base price for it.  Once
          they have bought it they will immediately identify the object. If
          it  is  a good object, they will add it to their inventory. If it
          was a bad bargain, they simply throw the item away. In any  case,
          you  may receive some knowledge of the item if another is encoun-
          tered.

          The General Store
               The  General  Store  sells  foods,  drinks,  some  clothing,
               torches,  lamps,  oil,  and  spikes. All of these items, and
               others, can be sold back to the General store for money. The
               entrance to the General Store is a `1'.

          The Armory
               The Armory is where the town's armor is fashioned. All sorts
               of protective gear may be bought and sold here. The entrance

               to the Armory is a `2'.

          The Weaponsmith's Shop
               The Weaponsmith's Shop  is  where  the  town's  weapons  are
               fashioned.  Hand  and  missile  weapons may be purchased and
               sold here, along with arrows, bolts, and shots. The entrance
               to the Weaponsmith's is a `3'.

          The Temple
               The Temple deals in healing and restoration potions, as well
               as bless scrolls, word-of-recall scrolls, some approved pri-
               estly weapons, etc. The entrance to the Temple is a `4'.

          The Alchemy shop
               The Alchemy Shop deals in all manner of potions and scrolls.
               The entrance to the Alchemy Shop is a `5'.

          The Magic User's Shop
               The Magic User's Shop is  the  most  expensive  of  all  the
               stores.  It deals in all sorts of rings, wands, amulets, and
               staves. The entrance to the Magic Shop is a `6'.

          Once your character is  adequately  supplied  with  food,  light,
          armor, and weapons, he is ready to enter the dungeon. Move on top
          of the `>' symbol and use the down `>'  command.  Your  character
          enters  a  maze  of interconnecting staircases and finally passes
          through a one-way door. He is now  on  the  first  level  of  the
          dungeon (50 feet), and must survive many horrible and challenging
          encounters to find the treasure lying about.


          _3._4._1.  _L_i_g_h_t

          There are two sources for light once inside  the  dungeon.   Per-
          manent  light which has been magically placed within rooms, and a
          light source carried by the player. If neither  is  present,  the
          character  will  be  unable  to map or see any attackers. Lack of
          light will also affect searching, picking locks, and disarming.

          A character must wield a torch or lamp in order to supply his own
          light. Once a torch or lamp has only 50 or less turns left before
          burning out, the message "Your light  is  getting  low"  will  be
          displayed  at  random intervals. Once a torch is burnt out, it is
          useless and can be dropped. A lamp or  lantern  can  be  refilled
          with  oil  by  using  the Fill `F' command. You must of course be
          carrying extra oil to refill a lantern.

          Attacking is simple in _m_o_r_i_a. If you move into  a  creature,  you



          Copyright                                Robert Alan Koeneke





          The Dungeons of Moria                                Page 23


          attack  him.  You can attack from a distance by firing a missile,
          or by magical means such as aiming a wand.  Creatures  attack  in
          the  same  way,  if  they  move  into you, they attack you.  Some
          creatures can cast  spells  from  a  distance,  and  dragon  type
          creatures  can  breath  from  a  distance, but these are the only
          exceptions.

          If you are wielding a weapon, the damage for the weapon  is  used
          when  you  hit  the creature. If you are wielding no weapons, you
          get two fist strikes. Note that very strong creatures  can  do  a
          lot  of damage with their fists... A character may have a primary
          and secondary weapon. A secondary weapon is kept on the belt,  or
          on  the  shoulder  for immediate use. You can switch between your
          primary and secondary weapons by using the exchange  command.  Be
          sure  you are wielding the proper weapon when fighting. Hitting a
          dragon over the head with a bow will simply make him mad, and get
          you killed.

          Missile weapons, such as bows,  can  be  wielded,  and  then  the
          proper  missile,  in  this case an arrow, can be fired across the
          room into a target. Missiles can be used without the proper  mis-
          sile  weapon,  but used together they have a greater range and do
          far more damage.

          Hits and misses are determined by ability to hit vs. armor class.
          A miss doesn't necessarily mean you failed to hit the target, but
          only that you failed to do any damage. Therefore  a  `hit'  is  a
          strike that does some damage. Higher armor classes make it harder
          to do damage, therefore more misses.


          _3._4._2._1.  _Y_o_u_r _W_e_a_p_o_n

          Carrying a weapon in your backpack does you  no  good.  You  must
          wield  a  weapon  before  it  can be used in a fight. Note that a
          secondary weapon can be kept by wielding it and  then  using  the
          exchange  command. A secondary weapon is not in use, simply ready
          to be switched with the current weapon if needed.

          Weapons have two main characteristics, their ability to  hit  and
          their  ability  to  do  damage,  expressed as `(+ ,+ )'. A normal
          weapon would be `(+0,+0)'. Many weapons  in  _m_o_r_i_a  have  magical
          bonuses  to  hit  and/or  do damage. Some weapons are cursed, and
          have penalties that hurt the player. Note that cursed swords can-
          not be un-wielded until the curse is lifted.

          Missile weapons, such as bows, have only one major characteristic
          which  is  to hit, expressed `(+ )'. This plus to hit is added to
          that of the missile used, if the proper weapon/missiles  combina-
          tion are used.

          Although you receive any magical bonuses an  unidentified  weapon
          may possess when you wield it, those bonuses will not be added in
          to the displayed values of to-hit and to-dam  on  your  character



          Copyright                                Robert Alan Koeneke

          sheet.  You  must identify the weapon before the displayed values
          reflect the real values used.

          Finally, some rare weapons  have  special  abilities.  These  are
          called  ego  weapons,  and  are  feared by great and meek. An ego
          sword must be wielded to receive benefit of its abilities.

          Special weapons are denoted by the following abbreviations:

          DF - Defender.
               A magical weapon that actually helps the wielder defend him-
               self, thus increasing his/her armor class.

          FB - Frost Brand.
               A magical weapon of ice that delivers  a  cold  critical  to
               heat based creatures.

          FT - Flame Tongue.
               A magical weapon of flame that delivers a heat  critical  to
               cold based creatures.

          HA - Holy Avenger.
               A Holy Avenger is by far the most powerful of weapons.  Holy
               Avengers   have  been  known  to  increase  several  of  the
               wielder's stats, to actually increase  the  wielder's  armor
               class (because of the terror the weapon spawns in its foes),
               and to actually help the wielder to fight more effectively.

          SD - Slay Dragon.
               A Slay Dragon weapon is a special purpose weapon whose  sole
               intent  is  to  destroy  dragon-kind.  Therefore,  when used
               against a dragon, the  amount  of  damage  done  is  greatly
               increased.

          SE - Slay Evil.
               A Slay Evil weapon is a special purpose  weapon  whose  sole
               intent is to destroy all forms of evil. When used against an
               evil creature, either alive or undead, the  damage  done  is
               greatly increased.

          SM - Slay Monster.
               A Slay Monster weapon is a special purpose weapon whose sole
               intent  is to destroy all the vile monsters of the world.  A
               monster is any creature not natural to the world.  Therefore
               an orc would be a monster, but a giant snake would not be.

          SU - Slay Undead.
               A Slay Undead weapon is a special purpose weapon whose  sole
               intent  is  to  destroy  all forms of undead. This weapon is
               hated and feared by the intelligent  undead,  for  a  single
               blow from this weapon is capable of destroying them.

          Weight is the primary factor in being able to bash something, but
          strength  plays a role too. After bashing, a character may be off
          balance for several rounds depending upon his dexterity.

          Doors can be broken down by bashing them. Once a door  is  bashed
          open, it is forever useless and cannot be closed.

          Chests too may be bashed open, but be warned  that  the  careless
          smashing  of  a  chest  often  ruins the contents. Bashing open a
          chest will not disarm any traps it may contain,  but  does  allow
          the strong and ignorant to see what is inside.

          Finally, a creature may be bashed. If a shield is currently being
          worn,  the  bash  is  a  shield bash and will do more damage.  In
          either case, a bash may throw  an  opponent  off  balance  for  a
          number of rounds, allowing a player to get in a free hit or more.
          If the player is thrown off-balance, his opponent  may  get  free
          hits on him. This is a risky attack.

          Armor class is a number that describes the amount and the quality
          of  armor being worn. Armor class will generally run from about 0
          to 40, but could become negative  or  greater  than  40  in  rare
          cases.

          The larger your armor class, the more protective it is.  A  nega-
          tive  armor class would actually help get you hit. Armor protects
          you in three manners. One, it makes you harder to be hit for dam-
          age.  A  hit for no damage is the same as a miss. Two, good armor
          will absorb some of the damage that  your  character  would  have
          taken.  An armor class of 30 would absorb 30% of any damage meant
          for him. Three, fire and acid damage are reduced by wearing  body
          armor.  It  is obvious that a high armor class is a must for sur-
          viving the lower levels of _m_o_r_i_a.

          Each piece of armor has an armor class adjustment, and a  magical
          bonus. Armor bought in town will have these values displayed with
          their description. Armor that is found within the dungeon must be
          identified  before  these  values will be displayed.  Armor class
          values are always displayed between a set of brackets `[  ,+  ]'.
          The first value is the armor class of the item. The second number
          is the magical bonus of the item, and will  always  have  a  sign
          preceding  the value. There are a few cases where the form `[+ ]'
          is used, meaning the object has no armor class,  only  a  magical
          armor bonus if worn.

          Some pieces of armor will possess special  abilities  denoted  by
          the following abbreviations:

          RA - Resist Acid.



          Copyright                                Robert Alan Koeneke





          The Dungeons of Moria                                Page 26


               This magical ability is usually enchanted  into  armor,  but
               may occasionally be found as an ability of a weapon. A char-
               acter using such an object will  take  only  quarter  damage
               from  any  acid  thrown  upon  him.  In  addition,  armor so
               enchanted will resist the acid's effects and not be  damaged
               by it.

          RC - Resist Cold.
               This magical ability is  also  found  in  both  weapons  and
               armor. A character using a resist cold object will take only
               one third damage from frost and cold.

          RF - Resist Fire.
               This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.   A
               character  using  a  resist  fire  object will take only one
               third damage from heat and fire.

          RL - Resist Lightning.
               This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.   A
               character using a resist lightning object will take only one
               third damage from electrical attacks.

          R - Resistance.
               This magical ability is found only  in  armor.  A  character
               wearing  armor  with  this  ability  will have resistance to
               Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning as explained  in  each  part
               above.


          _3._4._3.  _O_b_j_e_c_t_s _F_o_u_n_d _I_n _T_h_e _D_u_n_g_e_o_n

          The mines are full of objects just waiting to be  picked  up  and
          used.  How  did  they get there? Well, the main source for useful
          items are all the foolish adventurers  that  proceeded  into  the
          dungeon  before  you.  They  get killed, and the helpful monsters
          scatter the various treasure throughout the dungeon.  Most cursed
          items  are placed there by the joyful evil sorcerers, who enjoy a
          good joke when it gets you killed.

          You pick up objects by moving on top of them. You can carry up to
          22  different  items  in your backpack while wearing and wielding
          many others. Note that although you are limited to  22  different
          items,  you  may be carrying several of each item restricted only
          by  the  amount  of  weight  your  character  can  carry.    Your
          character's weight limit is determined by his strength.  Only one
          object may occupy any one given floor location, which may or  may
          not  also contain one monster. Note that doors, traps, and stair-
          cases are considered objects for this purpose.

          Many objects found within the dungeon have special  commands  for
          their use. Wands must be Aimed, staves must be Used, scrolls must
          be Read, and potions must be Quaffed. In any case, you must first
          be  able  to carry an object before you can use it. Some objects,
          such as chests, are very complex. Chests  contain  other  objects



          Copyright                                Robert Alan Koeneke

          and  may  be trapped, and/or locked. Read the list of player com-
          mands carefully for a further understanding of chests.

          One item in particular will be  discussed  here.  The  scroll  of
          "Word  of  Recall"  can be found within the dungeon, or bought at
          the temple in town. It acts in two manners, depending  upon  your
          current  location.  If  read within the dungeon, it will teleport
          you back to town. If read in town, it will teleport you back down
          to  the deepest level of the dungeon one which your character has
          previously been. This makes the scroll very  useful  for  getting
          back to the deeper levels of _m_o_r_i_a. Once the scroll has been read
          it takes a while for the spell to act, so don't expect it to save
          you in a crisis.

          And lastly, a final warning. Not all objects are what they  seem.
          Skeletons  lying  peacefully about the dungeon have been known to
          get up...

          Some objects, mainly armor and weapons, have had curses laid upon
          them.  These  horrible  objects  will  look like any other normal
          item, but will detract from your character's stats  or  abilities
          if  worn.  They  will also be impossible to remove until a remove
          curse is done.

          When a cursed item has been  identified,  an  asterisk  `*'  will
          appear  next  to  the inventory letter of the item. If you should
          wear a cursed item, you will immediately know it  is  cursed  and
          again the asterisk will appear.

          Much of the treasure within the dungeon can be found only by min-
          ing  it  out  of  the  walls. Many rich strikes exist within each
          level, but must be found and mined. Quartz veins are the richest,
          yielding the most metals and gems, but magma veins will have some
          hordes hidden within.

          Mining is virtually impossible without a pick or  shovel.   Picks
          and  shovels  have an additional magical ability expressed as `(+
          )'.  The higher the number, the better the magical digging  abil-
          ity  of  the  tool. Note that a pick or shovel also has pluses to
          hit and damage, and can be used as a weapon.

          When a vein of quartz or magma is located, the  character  should
          wield  his  pick or shovel and begin digging out a section.  When
          that section is removed, he should locate another section of  the
          vein,  and  begin  the  process again. Since granite rock is much
          harder to dig through, it is  much  faster  to  follow  the  vein
          exactly and dig around the granite.

          If the character has a scroll or staff of treasure  location,  he
          can  immediately  locate  all  strikes  of treasure within a vein
          shown on the screen. This makes mining much easier and more  pro-
          fitable.

          Staircases are the manner in which you get deeper, or  climb  out
          of  the  dungeon.  The symbols for the up and down staircases are
          the same as the commands to use them.  A  `<'  represents  an  up
          staircase  and  a  `>' represents a down staircase. You must move
          your character over the staircase before you can use them.

          Each level has at least one up staircase, and at least  two  down
          staircases.  There  are  no exceptions to this rule. You may have
          trouble finding some well hidden secret doors, but the stairs are
          there.

          Many secret doors are used within  the  dungeon  to  confuse  and
          demoralize  adventurers  foolish  enough  to enter. But with some
          luck, and lots of concentration, you can find these secret doors.

          Secret doors will sometimes hide  rooms  or  corridors,  or  even
          entire sections of that level of the dungeon. Sometimes they sim-
          ply hide small empty closets or even dead ends.

          Creatures in the dungeon will generally know and use this  secret
          doors.  If  they  leave  one  open,  you will be able to go right
          through it. If they close it behind them you will have to  search
          for  the  catch  first. Once a secret door has been discovered by
          you, it is drawn as a known door and no more  searching  will  be
          required to use it.

          Once your character has progressed into killing dragons with  but
          a mean glance and snap of his fingers, he may be ready to take on
          the Balrog. The Balrog will appear on every level after level 49,
          so don't go down there until you are ready for him.

          The Balrog cannot be killed in some of the easier methods used on
          normal  creatures.  Because  of  the  Balrog's  cunning,  he will
          teleport away to another level if a spell  such  as  genocide  is
          used  upon  him,  and the Balrog cannot be polymorphed, slept, or
          charmed. Magical spells like coldball are effective  against  him
          as  are  weapons,  but  he is difficult to kill and if allowed to
          escape for a time can heal himself.

          If you should actually survive the attempt of killing the Balrog,

          you  will  receive  the status of WINNER. Since you have defeated
          the toughest monster alive, your character is ready to retire and
          cannot  be saved. When you quit the game, your character receives
          a surprise bonus score and is entered into the toptwenty file.

          If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died and  can-
          not be restored. A tombstone showing information about your char-
          acter will be displayed with the option to print the  information
          to a file.

          After the tombstone, the toptwenty list of heroes  is  displayed.
          If  your  score  beats  any of the toptwenty, your character will
          join this elite rank of heroes. Otherwise, well, there is  always
          next time...

          There are rumors of _m_o_r_i_a Wizards which,  if  asked  nicely,  can
          explain  details  of  the  _m_o_r_i_a  game  that  seem complicated to
          beginners. In  addition,  they  have  special  spells  which  can
          restore characters lost by accident, such as power-outs and such.
